Simple message passing system

A simple system to pass messages between an end-user and different computer
systems.  Or something else.

Initial iteration serves as an example of how to create an SSL server in
Python 3 and pass messages between a client and server.

Requires openssl to be installed to be able to generate SSL certificate and
key.
